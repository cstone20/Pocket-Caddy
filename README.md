VERSIONS


The application has 2 versions, the versions differetiate mostly within the club setup portion and how collisions happen
choosing a yardage. Version 1 creates a range for each clubs yardage, using upper and lower distances entered for each particular club.
Version 2 uses an average distance for each club, which creates a range linking each clubs average distance to the next.

PLAYING A ROUND


You will start by choosing 9 or 18 holes and setting up club distances. After that simply follow prompts given throughout each hole to
get a detailed statistical summary of your round.
